# Bootcamp Demo React Native App

A very small ecommerce application focussing on fundamentals of React Native. The app consists of a landing page with search textInput, a product list page & a product display page (PDP). 

## Prerequisites

Install node + npm & then Expo

[Install npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
[Install Expo](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the app and running on your local machine/emulator/device for development & learning purposes:

- Fork the repo to your personal Github account
- Open terminal, navigate to project directory & run following commands
- *`npm i -g exp`* Install Expo
- *`npm install`* Install dependencies
- *`exp start`* Build Expo project & Run the bundler
- *`git checkout v1.0`* Checkout first version

Post this, jump to [How to proceed](#how-to-proceed)


## What will you learn
You will learn about following concepts:

- Making a complex layout using in-built components of React Native such as View, Image, Text, TextInput, Touchables, etc.
- Adding an external library to package.json & using it
- Handling Navigation between screens using `React Navigation`
- Handling Networking using `fetch` & `async-await`
- Creating a simple list layout
- Modifying a component for reusability

## How to proceed
This is an incremental project. You can proceed through the project by using git `tags` in the repo. The project is build step by step. Checkout the first tag(v1.0) to start. Here's a description of each step:

1. Blank expo project with Hello World layout - `v1.0`
2. A basic layout with TextInput, Button & Touchables - `v1.1`
3. Updated folder structure breaking down app to screens/sub apps & components - `v1.2`
4. Move the existing search screen to new folder structure - `v1.3`
5. Add an external navigation library(React Navigation) and navigate to a new screen - `v1.4`
6. Create a list based layout using `Flatlist` & a custom component - `v1.5`
7. Modify the Product component to make it reusable for Product Display Page(PDP) - `v1.6`
